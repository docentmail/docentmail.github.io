<pre id='novice' style="display:none">
1. if...else statement - basic usage with/without else;
2. understand the logic, sequence of checks, diagrams for all loops;
3. "for" loop purpose and basic practical usage;
4. "while" loop - basic practical usage;
5. "do-while" loop  - basic practical usage;
6. "switch" - basic practial usage. break; usage, what type could be ander switch;
7. for…in ; - don't need
8. for…of;  - don't need
9. loop control (label; break ; continue ); couple practical samples

if (isNight) {
    alert("It is night.") 
} else {
  alert("It is not night.")
}

– proposed snippet to modify
var size=5; // 6, 8

// put you if here
alert("The size fits");


– answer
var size=5; // 6, 8

if ( size > 5 and size < 7) {
    alert("The size fits");
}

- question 
Develop an snippet to use "if" statement to alert "type is number" if  in case the type variable "theVar"  is number, "type is string" if type is string less, "type is something else"  otherwise.

– proposed snippet to modify
var theVar=15; // "hello", [1];

// put you if here
alert("type is number");
alert("type is string");
alert("type is something else");

– answer
var theVar=15; // "hello", [1];

if (typeof theVar == "number") {
    alert("type is number");
} else if (typeof theVar == "string")  {
   alert("type is string"); 
} else {
    alert("type is something else");
}


3. -------------
Use "for" loop to concatenate all array elements in one string separated by ";"

4. -------------
Use "while" loop to concatenate all array elements in one string separated by ";"

5. -------------
Use "while-do" loop to concatenate all array elements in one string separated by ";"

3. -------------
replace "while" loop with "for" loop without changing the logic of snippet
var i = 0;
while (i < 100) {
  console.log(’Currently at ’ + i);
  i++; // increment i 
}

4. -------------
replace "for" loop with "while" loop without changing the logic of snippet
